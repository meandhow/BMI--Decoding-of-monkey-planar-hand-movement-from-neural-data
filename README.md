# BMI--Decoding-of-monkey-planar-hand-movement-from-neural-data

Group project done with 3 brilliant teammates. We were givan neural recording of macaque monkey collected when the monkey was performing 2D hand movements. 
Goal? Decode step-by-step trajectory. Applied a variety of solutions, including: variants of linear regression, deep learning model, population decoding. 
Read the report, its a good paper.

Created as submission for Brain Machine Interfaces module at Imperial College London
